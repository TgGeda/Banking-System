# Banking-System
A time and space efficient menu driven Banking System implementation using c that can read input from the user is safer way and uses a hash table for searching and delete record : 
1. Use a hash table for searching and deleting records - A hash table is a data structure that allows for quick searching and deleting of records. By using a hash table, you can reduce the time complexity of these operations to O(1) on average.

2. Implement a menu-driven interface - A menu-driven interface allows users to interact with the system by selecting options from a menu. This approach is intuitive and user-friendly, and it also helps to reduce the likelihood of user input errors.

3. Use dynamic memory allocation - Dynamic memory allocation allows you to allocate memory as needed during runtime. This approach can help to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

4. Implement input validation - Input validation is critical for ensuring the safety and security of the system. By validating user input, you can prevent errors and potential security vulnerabilities.

5. Use file I/O for data storage - File I/O allows you to store data on disk, which can help to reduce memory usage and improve performance. Additionally, it provides a way to persist data between program runs.

By following these guidelines, you can create a time and space efficient menu-driven banking system using C that is safe and user-friendly.
